In this post we will see on how to start and stop Azure Analysis Services using Azure DevOps release pipelines to save cost. There is a great blog about how to do it in automation account [here](http://microsoft-bitools.blogspot.com/2017/04/schedule-pauseresume-of-azure-analysis.html), however this can also be achieved via Azure DevOps pipeline and to avoid quite a bit of configuration in automation account to get it working as expected. So, let's use the script given in the blog and set up the pipelines.

### Tweak PowerShell Script

Let's create a function `Set-AASStatus` which takes arguments for parameters `$AasAction`, `$ResourceGroupName` and `$AnalysisServerName`.

```powershell
function Set-AASStatus {
    
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$True,Position=0)]
        [ValidateSet('Start','Stop')]
        [string]$AasAction,
        
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$True,Position=1)]
        [ValidateLength(1,100)]
        [string]$ResourceGroupName,
    
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$True,Position=2)]
        [ValidateLength(1,100)]
        [string]$AnalysisServerName
    )

    begin {
        # initialize function variables
        $Message = "Begin function"
        Write-Verbose $Message
    }

    process {
        try {
            $aas = Get-AzAnalysisServicesServer -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $AnalysisServerName

            if (-not $aas)
            {
                Write-Error "$AnalysisServerName not found in $ResourceGroupName"
                exit 0
            }
            else
            {
                $state = $aas.State
                Write-Verbose "Current status of $AnalysisServerName - $state"

                if (($AasAction -eq "Start" -and $aas.State -eq "Succeeded") -Or ($AasAction -eq "Stop" -and $aas.State -eq "Paused"))
                {
                    $state = $aas.State
                    Write-Error "Cannot $AasAction $AnalysisServerName while the status is $state"
                }
                # Resume Azure Analysis Services
                elseif ($AasAction -eq "Start")
                {
                    Write-Verbose "Now starting $AnalysisServerName"
                    $null = Resume-AzAnalysisServicesServer -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $AnalysisServerName
                }
                # Pause Azure Analysis Services
                else
                {
                    Write-Verbose "Now stopping $AnalysisServerName"
                    $null = Suspend-AzAnalysisServicesServer -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $AnalysisServerName
                }
            }
        }
        catch {
            throw $_
        }
    }

    end {
        $Message = "End Function"
        Write-Verbose $Message
    }
}

# We need this to create a task group in Azure DevOps and add in the release pipeline's task
Set-AASStatus -AasAction $(AasAction) -ResourceGroupName $(ResourceGroupName) -AnalysisServerName $(AnalysisServerName) -Verbose
```

Now that we have the script with minor tweaks and wrapped inside a function. Let's create a task group in release pipeline for this script, so that we can call it whenever required.

### Setup Release Pipelines

Let's setup the release pipelines to start and stop the AAS.

- Navigate to Azure DevOps and select **Releases** from **Pipelines** tab. Click on **New** and select **New Release Pipeline**, you will see a window similar as shown below.

<img src="/assets/media/AAS1.PNG" alt="AAS1">

Let's start with the empty job and for this task we are going to use classic editor.

- Click on `Empty Job` and name the environment in which you need to implement the action. For this post let's name the stage as Dev.

<img src="/assets/media/AAS2.PNG" alt="AAS2">

- Now we will have to schedule the release trigger to automatically create a release. Say that we have to turn on the AAS server at 7AM on weekdays and let it be turn off on weekends. This way we can save nearly 40-50% of overall cost.

<img src="/assets/media/AAS3.PNG" alt="AAS3">

- Click on `Schedule Set` in `Artifacts` stage and enable the schedule

<img src="/assets/media/AAS4.PNG" alt="AAS4">

- Click on `trigger` tab in `Stages` and set the schedule to automatically trigger the task/s in `Dev` stage. Note that we are selecting the trigger at 7:10AM as the release will be triggered at 7AM and there might me some delay to trigger the stage. To avoid this conflict let's keep a buffer time of 10 minutes in trigger schedule.

<img src="/assets/media/AAS5.PNG" alt="AAS5">

- Once the schedule is set click on tasks tab and click on `+` in `Agent Job` to add **Azure PowerShell** task from market place.

<img src="/assets/media/AAS6.PNG" alt="AAS6">

<img src="/assets/media/AAS7.PNG" alt="AAS7">

- Once the Azure PowerShell task is added copy and paste the `Set-AASStatus` script in the task. You can parameterize the `Azure Subscription` field or select the subscription from drop down list. Here we've parameterized the `Azure Subscription`, hence it is specified as **$(AzureSubscription)**

<img src="/assets/media/AAS8.PNG" alt="AAS8">

- Right click on **Azure PowerShell** task and click on **Create task group**. Creating a task group helps us to re-use it by passing mandatory parameters dynamically for each environment. Pretend that you need to perform this task for five environments (dev/test/uat/pre-prod/prod), task group helps you to pass values to the parameters `$AasAction`, `$ResourceGroupName` and `$AnalysisServerName` without the need of editing the script in each stage.

    You can find more about task groups [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/task-groups?view=azure-devops).

<img src="/assets/media/AAS9.PNG" alt="AAS9">

Click on create to create the task group.

- That's it, you're set. Pass the values to the parameters and click on save. If you add more stages follow the same steps and instead of selecting **Azure PowerShell** you can add the task group `Set-AASAction` and pass the values.

For more consistent pipeline settings, add the values in *Variables* tab by creating a `Pipeline Variables` and mapping it to each stage. You can view more about pipeline variables [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch).

- Follow same steps to create the release pipeline for stopping the AAS server by adding task group in tasks tab and passing the argument `Stop` to `AASAction` parameter.

### Conclusion

Setting up pipelines to start/stop AAS helps you to save costs and automate the process with few clicks.
